# Electric Store Management System

This project is a simulation of an electric store management system, developed entirely in C.

## Features
- Customer management (add, update, delete customers)
- Employee management with roles and permissions
- Item inventory management (add, update, delete items)
- Purchase and return processes
- Activity logging (purchases, returns, employee actions)

## Technical Highlights
- Modular code structure (separated `.c` and `.h` files)
- File handling: text and binary files
- Structured programming and error handling
- Data organization using `structs` and dynamic memory
